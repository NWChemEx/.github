# Contributing to the NWChemEx-Project

First, thank you for your interest in contributing to the NWChemEx project! We
strive to be a welcoming community. If you a newcomer to the project, or just
want to make some small contributions this page is for you. If you are going to
contribute a large feature, or do extensive development, we instead ask that
you become familiar with our more formal developer documentation located
[here](https://nwchemex-project.github.io/.github/).

## Asking Questions

Questions come up. We strive to have helpful documentation, but it's unlikely
to have all the answers. If you have a question, please search the
documentation and the GitHub issues for answers. If you can not find the
answer then feel free to open a GitHub issue with the question, using the
"Question" template.

## Ways to Contribute

There's three main ways to contribute:

1. Reporting Bugs

   NWChemEx uses GitHub's issue feature for bug tracking. If you think you have
   found a bug please first search the issues to see if it has already been
   reported. If not, feel free to open a new issue using the "Bug report"
   template.

2. Suggesting Features

    We're happy to consider implementing new features. Just be aware most of us
    are not directly paid to do software maintenance on NWChemEx, which means it
    may take us a while to implement the feature. Like bugs, we use GitHub's
    issue feature for tracking feature requests. Please do a quick search to
    make sure someone else hasn't already suggested the feature. If the feature
    is indeed new, then please open a new issue using the "Feature request"
    template.

3. Contributing Code

    Please note that NWChemEx is a large project, with many moving pieces. We
    are also very concerned with performance. This requires planning, and
    maintaining a unified design. Until you are familiar with the inner workings
    of NWChemEx and the overall design, we **strongly** recommend chatting with
    a more established developer **before** spending any extensive time writing
    code. The best way to do this is by opening a draft pull request (PR) and
    articulating what you intend to do, and how you intend to do it. While we
    strive to be an open and welcoming community, the size of the project
    mandates that we adhere to the unifying design to keep things on track. PRs
    will need to be aligned with this design before they can be merged.

    That all said, we understand that this may seem daunting for new developers.
    We also understand it takes time to come to grips with the project. We
    consider ourselves a welcoming and helpful community and are more than
    willing to walk you through the process and answer any questions you may
    have. Just remember we all started somewhere.

    Also if you're just committing a small change, no need to run it by us. Just open the (non-draft) PR with the change!

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Since the NWChemEx project is developed primarily by the U.S. Department of
Energy, you will need sign a CLA for legal reasons. When you make a PR, you will
automatically be prompted to view and sign the CLA (if you have  not already).
The contents of the CLA are:

```
By contributing computer software code to the CMakePP project I certify that the

```

This should be self-explanatory, but if you have questions just ask.
