    As of 12/7/2022 GitHub does not allow multiple PR templates. Our solution
    is to create one master PR template for all use cases, please delete the
    use cases which are not relevant for your PR. Sorry about the extra step.

# General PR Questions

<!---
    Please answer all questions in this section for all PRs.
--->

**Brief Description**
<!---
    In a couple sentences, describe what this pull request will accomplish. If
    there is a corresponding issue please link to it with
    [closing words](
        https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-
        using-a-keyword)
    as appropriate. If the goal is more complicated than can be articulated in
    a few sentences, please first open an issue and explain it in detail
    there.
--->

**Not In Scope**
<!---
    Some features have obvious extensions or use cases. If you're only targeting
    a specific use case and don't want to worry about other use cases in this
    PR please make that clear.
--->

**PR Type**
<!---
    Please check the corresponding box.

    A "patch" is a PR which touches relatively few lines of code. Patches
    usually address bugs, minor performance issues, typos, clarify
    documentation, etc. Most patches are ready to go in a day or two.

    A "feature" is a PR which adds a major new capability, massively overhauls
    an existing feature, writes entirely new documentation pages, or optimizes
    an extensive algorithm. Features usually take at least a week to implement.

    "Breaking change" is a PR which will break existing user-facing code. These
    types of PRs must be discussed in advance. They may be very small, or very
    extensive PRs depending on the change.

**PR Checklist**

<!---
    Know that unless you are brand-new contributor (in which case we're just
    happy to have your contribution), or arrangements have been
    made in advance, your PR will in general be rejected until you have
    addressed the items in the following checklist. That said, depending on
    the content of the PR, some of the checklist may not apply. In that case
    they obviously won't be held against you. Please ask for clarification if
    you are not sure how to address something on the list.
--->

- [ ] API Documentation
- [ ] User and/or developer documentation
- [ ] Update existing documentation (mainly for patches)
- [ ] Design documentation (for features or breaking changes only)
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Formatting according to organization standards

# Draft PRs Only
<!---
    We strongly encourage all PR authors to open PRs as early as possible.
    When you do that your PR is usually not ready for review. Fill this section
    out in that case. Note we encourage breaking PRs down into chunks which
    can be merged within two weeks. If you expect that your TODO list is too
    large please break the PR down into smaller PRs.
--->

**TODOs**
<!---
    Please include a list of what needs to be done beyond the normal PR
    checklist.
--->

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
