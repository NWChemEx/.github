# NWChemEx Branding Images (Logos for short)

This directory contains images used to define the NWChemEx and NWChemEx
Community brands.

# Usage

To link to an image in a markdown file (such as the NWChemEx Community website
or a repo's README) do:

```
![alt text](https://github.com/NWChemEx/.github/blob/master/assets/logos/xxx)
```

where `xxx` should be replaced with the directory and the image you want. Note
that GitHub will only display PNG and JPEG images.

AFAIK you must make a copy of an image to link to it in reStructuredText, i.e.,
you can't embed an image stored in a different repo.

# Directory Layout

The NWChemEx logos are grouped into four categories:

1. Badges - Used to display one's role in the NWChemEx Community (TODO: link to
   community roles).
2. Banners - Meant to be used as a splashy representation of NWChemEx, e.g.,
   as banners at the top of web pages, or in the acknowledgements of a slide
   deck (when space is limited we instead recommend the full color logo).
3. Full Color Logos - These are just the word "NWChemEx" stylized so that the
   "NWChem" is one color and the "Ex" is another. You're welcome to use these
   logos on their own, but they're primarily meant to be used as pieces of the
   badges and banners.
4. Mono Color Logos - Similar to the full color logos, but "NWChemEx" is a
   single color. These logos for applications where
   the name may be rendered in black and white.

For reference we also have the CMYK and Pantone (PMS) codes for the colors.

## Notes on File Formats

Each logo is available in three file formats: JPG, PNG, and EPS. EPS is a
vector format and recommended when you are going to be significantly enlarging
the logos (for example on posters), particularly when the logo is going to be
printed out. EPS files are large and their usage in websites etc. may inhibit
performance. For virtual branding we recommend the PNG images (or the JPG if
the PNG is still too large). Note that JPG and EPS are NOT vector formats and
thus they should be used at their original size (or smaller) to avoid
pixelation (n.b., PNG usually supports some enlarging without noticeable pixelation).

# Acknowledgements

Logos were designed by Grant Luhmann at Ames National Laboratory. The NWChemEx
team is thankful for the time and effort Grant spent preparing these awesome
images.
