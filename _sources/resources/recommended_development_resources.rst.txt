Recommended Development Resources

The point of this page is to collect a list of recommended programs,
applications, and websites for performing development tasks.

Naming Libraries and Repos
--------------------------

https://namelix.com
   Namelix uses AI to generate possible names for your package. You provide
   keywords about your package, tweak some options, and it returns tons of
   results. You can customize the length and style (mispellings, rhyming words,
   *etc.*) of the generated names.

Drawing Documentation Diagrams
------------------------------

https://excalidraw.com
   Excalidraw has an easy to use API which allows you to quickly draw UML-like
   diagrams. You can export the diagram as a PNG or SVG (embedding the code
   for the diagram in the image so you can modify it later). Another cool
   feature is that you can share the diagram with other people and you can all
   work on the diagram in real time.
