Recommended Development Resources
#################################

The point of this page is to collect a list of recommended programs,
applications, and websites for performing development tasks.

**************************
Naming Libraries and Repos
**************************

https://namelix.com
   Namelix uses AI to generate possible names for your package. You provide
   keywords about your package, tweak some options, and it returns tons of
   results. You can customize the length and style (mispellings, rhyming words,
   *etc.*) of the generated names.

******************************
Drawing Documentation Diagrams
******************************

https://excalidraw.com
   Excalidraw has an easy to use API which allows you to quickly draw UML-like
   diagrams. You can export the diagram as a PNG or SVG (embedding the code
   for the diagram in the image so you can modify it later). Another cool
   feature is that you can share the diagram with other people and you can all
   work on the diagram in real time.

**************************************
Creating ASCII File Structure Diagrams
**************************************

https://ascii-tree-generator.com/
   This is a simple web app which provides a GUI that acts like a file browser.
   In the GUI you can create folders and files and drag them around to nest
   them. The app then generates an ASCII representation of the file system which
   you can then copy/paste into documentation (or wherever else you want to
   put the diagram).
