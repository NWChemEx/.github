Developing NWChemEx
###################

The topics in this part focus on how to develop new modules for NWChemEx. The
topics are concerned with literally writing the code. It is thus assumed that
you understand:

- the basics of C++,
- how to build a C++ package,
- the basics of CMake,
- the basics of Python,
- SDE topics such as property types and modules,
- how to write a module/property type,
- and the design of NWChemEx.

.. TODO:

   Add links so people can educate themselves on these topics.
