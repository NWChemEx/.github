Contributing to NWChemEx Documentation
**************************************

In this section we explain the basic orgnization of the NWChemEx documentation
system and present instructions on how to contribute to the documentation.

Structure of NWChemEx Documentation
===================================

In the repo of every NWChemEx package, there is a ``docs`` directory. Under
this diretory there is a ``source`` subdirectory which contains all .rst
source files of the documentation (recursive subdirectory structures may 
exist). The files ``Makefile`` and ``requirements.txt`` are for generating 
formatted files of the documentation, and will be explained below. The 
``README.md`` file briefly decscribes the documentation and how to generate 
the documentation files. 

How to Contribute to NWChemEx Documentation
===========================================
Suppose one plans to update the documentation of the package PluginPlay. 
First, one should create a local working copy of the PluginPlay repo using 
``git clone``, then edit the existing .rst files or create new .rst files 
under the ``doc`` directory.
Remember, when new .rst files are added, one needs to add the names of the
new files into the toctree list in the ``index.rst`` file under the same 
directory.
When all editing work is done one needs to generate a local copy of the 
documentation (see below), usually in html format, and check the .html files 
in a browser to make sure everything is displayed properly. Finally one can 
open a pull request to the PluginPlay repo and merge the updated documentation 
to master.

Note: the developer documentation of NWChemEx resides in the .github repo.


How to Generate a Local Copy of the Documentation
=================================================

NWChemEx uses `Sphinx - a Python documentation generator 
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ to transform the 
source files (.rst, .md. etc) into documentation files in various formats
(.html, .pdf, etc). One can see the content of the file ``requirements.txt``
with the linux command ``vi``:

.. code-block:: console

   docutils<=0.19
   sphinx
   sphinx_rtd_theme

This list contains the required Python packages to install. We recommend to 
install these packags into a Python virtual environment, in order to avoid 
possible conflicts in the base environment. One can run the linux commands

.. code-block:: console

   python3 -m venv venv
   . venv/bin/activate
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

to create a virtual environment ``venv``, activate it, and then install the
required packages into it.
Note: during the installation of the packages, one may see an error message
like "*ERROR: sphinx-rtd-theme 1.2.0 has requirement docutils<0.19, but you'll 
have docutils 0.19 which is incompatible.*". This is a known issue, but not 
affecting documentation generation.

After all packages are successfully installed, one can run

.. code-block:: console

   make html

under the directory of ``docs`` to generate the documentation in .html format.
One can also choose other formats, for example, .pdf, for the generated 
documentation files by running

.. code-block:: console

   make latexpdf

In this case the installation of additional packages such as ``latexmk`` might
be necessary. 
After successfully running these ``make`` commands, a directory of ``build``
would be created under ``docs``. So one can go to the subdirectories ``html`` 
or ``latex`` to check whether generated .html or .pdf files are correct or not.
