Design Documentation

This section focuses on documentation relating to the overall design philosophy
and implementation of the NWChemEx package. The documentation is laid out to
give you a top-down approach to the design. That is to say it starts very
general and high-level, and as you progress through the design more details are
added. The design documents in this section describe the overall project design,
but do not specify how the components are designed. Consult the documentation of
the individual components for details pertaining to their respective designs.
