******************************************************
When do I open an issue vs. a draft pull request (PR)?
******************************************************

TL;DR, if you're not sure, open an issue first.

Draft PRs are meant to signal to the community that you intend to work on a
task, are ready to get started on it, and have a pretty good idea of how you
are going to accomplish the task. It should be possible to accomplish the task
in about two weeks (if you go over two weeks we're not going to close your PR
or anything, that's just a suggestion). Conversations in PRs should focus on
reviews of the code and what needs to happen to get it merged.

If you need help designing, are not sure how to implement the task, or think
that the task will take longer than two weeks, you probably want to open an
issue first (specifically a feature request issue). Admittedly, the distinction
is not always as clear cut as we tried to depict here and whether to open an
issue or a draft PR is somewhat subjective. If you open a draft PR, but should
have opened an issue, or vice versa, it's fine.
