NWChemEx Organization Conventions
#################################

The NWChemEx organization consists of a multitude of developers, spread out
across a number of geographic locations. In an attempt to provide a unified
development experience it is important that all developers strive to adhere
to same conventions. The topics in this section cover conventions for writing
code (*i.e.*, coding conventions), and structuring a GitHub repository (*i.e.*,
repository conventions).
